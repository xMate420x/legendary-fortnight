<p align=center><b>legendary-fortnight</b><br>A comprehensive study of the GitHub random repository name generator</p>

## Introduction
As we all know, GitHub allows you to choose a repository name randomly upon the creation of said repository. These names vary from 2 to 3 word sentences. The suffix is always a descriptor, for 3 word sentences the infix can contain an extension of the descriptor (prefix), or a custom infix (like 'octo'), and the suffix can be almost anything that descriptors can apply to.
Even the name of this repository was made with said generator, to showcase the possibilities it can provide.

## Pseudocode
I tried to mimic the random name generation as best I can, I got the probability for 3 word sentences almost exact to the original, along with the word selection process. The code I wrote for it in Python is available in the ./pseudocode/ directory. It will require further work to be perfect, but this is a good start.
